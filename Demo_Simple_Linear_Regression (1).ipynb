One interpretation: If a penguin's flipper gets 1 millimeter longer, the penguin's body mass will increase by 29.4380 grams on average. Another interpretation: Penguins with 1 millimeter longer flippers have 29.4380 grams higher body mass on average. \n","\n","The results are statistically significant with a p-value of 0.000, which is a very small value (and smaller than the common significance level of 0.05). This indicates that there is a very low probability of observing data as extreme or more extreme as what is seen in the penguins dataset when the null hypothesis is true. In this context, the null hypothesis is that there is no relationship between flipper length and body mass i.e. the slope is zero, and the alternative hypothesis is that there is a relationship between flipper length and body mass i.e. the slope is not zero. So, you could reject the null hypothesis and state that there is a relationship between flipper length and body mass for Adelie and Chinstrap penguins. \n","\n","The slope of the line of best fit that resulted from the regression model is approximate and subject to uncertainty (not the exact value). The 95% confidence interval for the slope is from 22.303 to 36.573. This indicates that there is a 95% probability that the interval [22.303, 36.573] contains the true value for the slope. \n","\n","**A story you could present to stakeholders:**\n","\n","Based on the dataset at hand and regression analysis, there is a notable relationship between flipper length and body mass for Adelie and Chinstrap penguins, with a p-value of 0.000 and standard error of 3.620. For such penguins with 1 millimeter longer flippers, their body mass is  29.4380 grams more on average. If you are looking for insight that will help determine how to distribute food amongst penguins of these species at your zoo, consider the following: You could allocate resources so that penguins with longer flippers are fed larger servings proportional to their flipper length, to support/sustain their body mass.
